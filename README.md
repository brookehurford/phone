#Project 1 // JS Foundations // Hack Oregon

###By: Brooke Hurford
Create a phone app.

###Project Instructions:

* Write a Node program that uses some sort of loop to buy phones and accessories when you have enough money to do so.
* Add a “spending threshold” such that you have at least that much money left in your account when you are done.
* Make sure you are adding a 9% tax to all of your purchases.
* Include helper functions. At the very least, you’ll need ones to calculate tax and convert dollar numbers to strings with “$” and exactly two decimal places.
* Your program should console.log at a minimum what was purchased, for how much, and how much money is left over. You can of course log out more if you’d like.

###Installation Instructions
